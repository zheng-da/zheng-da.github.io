I'm an applied scientist at AWS AI, where I'm working on [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/)
and [DGL-KE](https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-ke) for graph neural networks and knowledge graphs.
My research interest covers areas, ranging from high-performance computing,
large-scale data analysis systems, and machine learning. I got a PhD from
the department of computer science at the Johns Hopkins University. During my PhD,
I worked on [FlashGraph](https://github.com/flashxio/FlashX) and
[FlashR](https://github.com/flashxio/FlashR), frameworks for large-scale graph analysis
and data analysis on solid-state drives (SSDs).
